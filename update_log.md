### Hell Yeah Simulator
> Cleaned up the store menu dialogue from just a stack of lines to a table. Defined the delayed_print below since they are all set to 0.5

### To-do:
> Add compatability for choosing brands from the store. Currently it is generic and you select a brand when using the item, but later I want brands to show separately in your inventory.
