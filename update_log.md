# UPDATE LOG

## 06.09.25

### Hell Yeah Simulator
> Cleaned up the store menu dialogue from just a stack of lines to a table. Defined the delayed_print below since they are all set to 0.5

> Standardised the 'choice' function's input request to "Your choice:". This applies to the store and the menu.

> Listed the global variables in 1 line rather than stacking.

> Added the choice function standardisation to the item usage actions. Before now, they were just a generic input prompts.

## 07.09.25

> Added coolness values for beer brands. Easily copiable and configurable for any future items now.

## To-do:
> Add compatability for choosing brands from the store. Currently it is generic and you select a brand when using the item, but later I want brands to show separately in your inventory.

> Add weed
